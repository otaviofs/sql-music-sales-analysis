## Project Description

This project involves creating an SQL query that replicates the result of a table showing the sales value of songs by artist and genre, the percentage of sales by genre, and the cumulative sum of these percentages. The table is ordered ascending by genre name and descending by sales percentage by genre.

## Table Structure

The table generated by the query contains the following columns:

- **artist**: Name of the artists who authored the sold/billed songs.
- **genre**: Genre of the songs.
- **sales**: Revenue value for the songs sold by that artist in that genre.
- **sales_by_percentage_by_genre**: Percentage of sales value for a given artist and genre by the total sales in the genre.
- **cumulative_sum_by_genre**: Cumulative sum of the values in the `sales_by_percentage_by_genre` column. The cumulative sum results in 100% for the last song listed for each genre.
